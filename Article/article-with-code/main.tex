	\maketitle
	\begin{abstract}
		This article (and its source main.tex) shows how to create a block of code i.e. snippet of any programming language and insert into our own project document. A lot of customization is available for the styling of block such as highlighting, block-format, language-specification, captions, etc. This source will clear your understanding from basic of how to insert code in a \LaTeX \  document flawlessly.
	\end{abstract}
	\section{Introduction}
		I've nothing more to write in introduction sections, so skip it directly to code section.
	
	\section{Code}
		Here is a simple C program that prints directory of this repository.
		\insertcode{"Scripts/example.c"}{C program template-1.} 
	
		Here is another example of Python3 program that also prints the same. Note that comments are not recognized as comments, thats because of fact that we have written "C" in language column of defining style; see source main.tex for more information.
		\insertcode{"Scripts/example.py"}{Python program template-1}
	
	\section{Conclusions}
		Inserting code inside a \LaTeX document is been learnt.
	
	\section{References}
		\LaTeX \ community, stackoverflow.com, and latex-templates.com
