# Article with Code

I'm very lazy thats why I've copied my abstract section of [main.pdf](https://github.com/Jishanshaikh4/latex-templates/blob/master/Article/article-with-code/main.pdf) generated from [main.tex](https://github.com/Jishanshaikh4/latex-templates/blob/master/Article/article-with-code/main.tex) here-

### Abstract

This article (and its source main.tex) shows how to create a block of code i.e. snippet of any programming language and insert into our own project document. A lot of customization is available for the styling of block such as highlighting, block-format, language-specification, captions, etc. This source will clear your understanding from basic of how to insert code in a \LaTeX \  document flawlessly.
